# DodgeCube

_Like Dodgeball but with more corners_

## Concept

DodgeCube is a Spigot server plugin that adds dodgeball like kill based bans to your server. Whenever a player is killed by another player, they are banned from the game until the player that killed them dies or a predetermined time limit is up.

## Installation

- Head over to [Releases](https://github.com/InitialPosition/DodgeCube/releases)
- Download the latest DodgeCube.jar and place it in the plugins folder of your Spigot server

On first startup the plugin generates a config file. It is recommended to edit this file to your liking and reloading/restarting the server afterwards

## Features

- Kill based player bans
- Customization

## Roadmap

- [ ] Implement config file functionality
- [ ] Make listeners work correctly
- [ ] Complete logic
